# Data Centric AI

We're collecting (an admittedly opinionated) list of resources and progress made 
in data-centric AI, with exciting directions from our own lab and collaborators.

AI has been too focused on the models, while in reality, the experience of those who put 
models into production or use them in real applications is that data matters most. 

It's the data that's unique, not the models.
