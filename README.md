# Data Centric AI

We're collecting (an admittedly opinionated) list of resources and progress made 
in data-centric AI, with exciting directions from our own lab and collaborators.

AI has been too focused on the models, while in reality, the experience of those who put 
models into production or use them in real applications is that data matters most. 

It's the data that's unique, not the models.

# Emerging Directions

## Embeddings
Widespread use: shift in how information is represented.
- The take over of Word2Vec and BERT
- Epoxy
- Replacing influence functions via NN
- Hidden Stratification + GEORGE
- VLDB Tutorial [upcoming]

## Interactive Machine Learning
- Forager
- Mosaic DataPanels

## Fine-Grained Evaluation & Measurement
- Robustness Gym
- Mandoline

## Data Representations (model more closely represents data)
- LSSLSLSLSSSL (Albert)
- Hyperbolics (??)


## Universal Models
- GPT-X/BERT-X/T-87/Chinese model
- MLPs everywhere
- Shift towards data curation
- These models have issues
- But companies don't seem to care (Anthropic, OpenAI, ...)
- The Stanford class

## Model Guidability/Shaping: like coding with metadata and data
- Data shaping
- Bootleg
