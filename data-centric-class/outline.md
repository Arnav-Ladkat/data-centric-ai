# A Course in Data-Centric AI

This document includes an outline for an introductory class to data-centric AI. As data-centric AI is an emerging topic, it will be raw and drawn from the cutting edge of research. Key technical ideas like weak and self-supervision will be explained with both practical case studies and their mathematical foundations. As a result of spanning both applications and theory, this course will be demanding. 

Topics covered include weak supervision, self-supervision, and foundations of data augmentation. The course will describe foundations of recent techniques like no-code AI systems, monitoring and measurement of systems, robustness, and the use of structured data (knowledge graph embedding).
